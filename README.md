# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

Simple game of Tic Tac Toe. This game is for two players and to win a player would need to line up their tokens three in a row, column or diagonal.


### Project Motivation

The Tic Tac Toe project aims to teach me how the DOM and Data Model works with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create functional and interactive websites.


## Project Information
#### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

#### Code Architecture
* The Data model used is the Game class instance that is created.
* The instance of the Game is created using two instances of the Player class
* The DOM is then updated using the Game instance's information.

#### Code Sample

```javascript
function playTurn() {
  if (event.target.id) {
    var id = parseInt(event.target.id);
    var winOrDraw = ticTacToe.takeTurn(id);
    displayBoard();
    displayPlayerTurn(winOrDraw);
  }
}
```
